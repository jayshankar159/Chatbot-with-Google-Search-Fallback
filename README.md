# Chatbot-with-Google-Search-Fallback
This is a simple personal chatbot built using Python + spaCy (NLP)
It can chat with users, answer casual questions (like greetings, feelings, hobbies, etc.), and if it doesn’t understand the input, it automatically redirects the user to Google Search.

# ✨ Features
🧠 NLP with spaCy → Understands user queries using tokenization and lemmatization.
🎯 Intent Matching → Handles basic small-talk like greetings, feelings, hobbies, age, and name.
🔀 Randomized Responses → Gives varied replies to make conversations feel more natural.
🌍 Google Search Fallback → If no intent matches, the chatbot politely redirects the user to Google.
